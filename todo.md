# To Do:


- [x] Make the code faster, shorter, and cacheable possible rewrite to JavaScript
- [ ] (1/1/2023) Add a thing that when it isn't a set time away, it changes `Time` to `Status` and "ARR, DLY, and BRD to their status spelled out (i.e ARR ==> Arriving)
- [x] Add minification of CSS to the build chain
- [x] Make `json.load()` calls with context management.
- [ ] (1/1/2023) **IMPORTANT** Add filtering by time to station (i.e BRD is top and 59mins is last always.)
- [ ] Grey out the dashes if the \# of cars returns `-`
- [x] Optimize the JS indexing
- [x] Add pointer to links
- [ ] Take advantage of JS so we don't have to use the ~~hacky~~ CSS class selectors.
- [ ] Highlight somehow or change the colour of the 8 vs 6 car trains
- [ ] Add a feature to not overload the API so when the page is not in focus it will not update information
- [ ] Add a thing at the bottom that updates every time it refresh the data to show the time it was last updated (i.e Last Updated: mm:dd:yyyy @ hh:mm:ss)
- [ ] Add a dropdown menu at the bottom where you can select another station you would like to view
- [x] Resized the images to load faster
- [ ] Add links to the station names eg Virginia Square-GMU onlick event redirects to https://wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/virginia-sq.cfm
